In the development of the kidney stone detection software, meticulous attention was given to critical aspects. This included careful consideration of the format of CT scans, selection of the model for algorithm training, defining the targeted accuracy, and accounting for control variables. Once these prerequisites were established, we embarked on the model development phase, curating a dataset of CT scans and leveraging the Keras module, acquired from PIP.

Our proposed system encompasses a user-friendly graphical interface soliciting input images. Subsequently, the input image is processed through the trained model, employing Keras, for meticulous analysis of CT scans to detect kidney stones. Upon identification, the software provides a positive result, which is then seamlessly communicated to the user through the GUI as 'Kidney Stone Detected.
